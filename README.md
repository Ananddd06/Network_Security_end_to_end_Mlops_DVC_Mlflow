# 🔐 Network Security 🛡️ | End-to-End MLOps Pipeline 🚀

Welcome to the **Network Security Threat Detection** project — an end-to-end implementation of a production-grade ML pipeline integrating modern **MLOps tools** including **MLflow, DVC, Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, and Dagshub**.

> 💡 Designed for real-world use cases like intrusion detection using machine learning — deployable, trackable, reproducible, and scalable!

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

In this project, we tackle the problem of **network intrusion detection** using ML algorithms. Our goal is to build a pipeline that:

- Ingests network traffic data
- Preprocesses and extracts meaningful features
- Trains a model to classify normal vs suspicious activity
- Deploys the model with full **CI/CD** and **MLOps support**

---

## 🧪 ML Pipeline Components

### 🛠️ Data Versioning with DVC

- ✅ Tracks raw and processed datasets
- ✅ Pipeline defined in `dvc.yaml`
- ✅ Remote storage: [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com)

### 🧪 Experiment Tracking with MLflow

- 🎯 Log metrics, parameters, and artifacts
- 📊 Compare multiple models & runs visually
- 🧠 Integrate with sklearn pipeline easily

### 🐳 Containerization with Docker

- Reproducible environments
- Easy deployment across dev/stage/prod

### 🔄 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

- Every `push` or `PR` triggers:
  - ✅ Code linting
  - ✅ Unit tests
  - ✅ DVC pipeline execution
  - ✅ MLflow tracking
  - ✅ Docker build & push

### 📡 Deployment Ready

- Containerized inference API (FastAPI or Flask)
- Ready for deployment on **AWS/GCP/Azure** or **Heroku**

## ⚙️ Run the Project Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-security-mlops.git
cd network-security-mlops

# 2. Set up DVC
dvc pull   # Pull data from remote storage
dvc repro  # Reproduce the entire pipeline

# 3. Track experiments
mlflow ui  # Launch MLflow dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:5000

# 4. Build Docker container
docker build -t network-mlops-app .
docker run -p 8000:8000 network-mlops-app

```

# 📈 MLflow Example Output

- 🔢 Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve
- 📁 Model artifact: RandomForestClassifier.pkl
- 📊 Visual run comparison dashboard

---

## 🚧 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/mlops.yml`  
Runs the full pipeline on every push:

- ✅ Lint + Tests
- ✅ DVC repro
- ✅ MLflow log
- ✅ Docker image push

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- ✨ Add LSTM or Deep Learning models
- 📦 Convert to FastAPI microservice
- 🔐 Add role-based access control for logs
- 📊 Grafana + Prometheus monitoring
- ☁️ Deploy to AWS Sagemaker or GCP AI Platform
